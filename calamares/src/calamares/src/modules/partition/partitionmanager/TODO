===============================================================================

For releases after 1.1:

* add a way for the user to remove an existing mount point

* make Job::copyBlocks() work for cases where the logical sector sizes of
  source and target are not the same

* can we use capacity (i.e. bytes/mib) instead of sector for alignment
  configuration? would we need to know the physical sector size for that? are
  we able to acquire that information?

* find an elegant solution for the brokenness in design that is
  Partition::sectorSize()... Either a Partition has a reference/pointer to the
  Device it's on or the method is removed completely. -- Maybe the
  PartitionTable should refernce the Device?

* the file system support dialog is a usability nightmare

* introduce new commands for online-actions, like change label online or, for
  filesystems that support it, even resize online

* write a setup-kcm in the style of k3b's so that the user can set the r/w
  permissions of the disks there; also use kauth to update the partition table
  in the kernel. that should cover all cases where we actually need root
  privileges now. -- we actually also need root privs for SMART now.

* The whole lvm/dm debacle.

* The interface between core and the file systems needs some more thought.
  Ideally we'd be free to use either external helper apps (like we do now) or
  libraries to achieve the same things. Libraries in this case being libntfs-3g
  and libext2fs. There's one for reiserfs too, iirc.

* Convert the fs implementations into plugins. Redesign the support-stuff, make
  that more flexible (no statics in the FS classes, some helper class or at
  least an array in FileSystem).

* Add a SMART self test operation.

* support KLocale::BinaryUnitDialect and use KLocale's formatting methods (how
  feasable is that? does it make sense?)

* Information about file system on a separate tab in the properties, unique
  to the file system in use.

* let the user specify external command locations and options in the settings;
  use some program and binary management setup internally like k3b has it

* parse progress information at least from e2fsck and ntfsclone... maybe others.
